The research was done mainly in FreeBSD 5, and later attempts
on later releases as FreeBSD 13

The server files where found inside a FreeBSD 5 VM image, so
its presumed that it is the ideal environment for compatibility


On progress (may change)
=========================

It was also attempted on a later release like FreeBSD 13, however
it was not possible to progress when testing binaries due to lack
of compatible libraries (MySQL Client 4) and also issues with localization
(not able to load files with chinese names)
